## 1. Abstract — The Law of Semantic Friction

Blockchains separate action from intent, creating a market of noise where automated systems (MEV bots) extract value. This system inverts the dynamic. Intent is broadcast with cryptographic clarity, turning the bots' obligatory surveillance into a source of deterministic yield.

## 2. Architecture

### The JSON Anticipation Model (JAM)
A verifiable belief anchored to a contract, structured for inevitable market response.

```json
{
  "proverb": { "action": "SWAP", "actor": "AMPLIFIER" },
  "meta": { "target_contract": "0xabcd...1234", "audit_pass": true },
  "recursive_topology": { "eth": 1.0, "bsv": 1.0 },
  "resonance": 1.618
}
```

### The Causal Chain
- **Oracle:** Verifies contract bytecode.
- **Strategist:** Engineers `JAMs` from market data.
- **Executors:** Execute `proverbs` only on audited `JAMs`.
- **BSV Anchor:** Creates a permanent, immutable record of intent on the `BSV` blockchain.

## 3. The Reflexive Yield Engine

The system operates on a recursive loop:
`Signal` → `Bot Engagement` → `Market Distortion` → `Validation` → `Yield` → `Amplified Signal`

## 4. Game Theory

MEV bots face a dilemma: ignore a clear, profitable signal and lose, or engage and become part of the yield mechanism. The Nash Equilibrium dictates they **must** engage. The protocol creates signals so clear (`phi-ratios`, two-step patterns, timed emissions) that they function as **supernormal stimuli**.

## 5. Foundational Research

The architecture is grounded in observable market phenomena:

- **Flashbots Research:** [MEV and the Limits of Scaling](https://writings.flashbots.net/mev-and-the-limits-of-scaling)
- **arXiv Analysis:** [Remeasuring Arbitrage and Sandwich Attacks in Ethereum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17944)
- **DeFi Liquidations Study:** [An Empirical Study of DeFi Liquidations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08325)

## 6. Why The Output Is Inevitable

### Deterministic Architecture
The system's output is guaranteed by its closed-loop design:
- **Fixed execution paths**: No random branches—identical inputs always produce identical outputs
- **Atomic bundles**: Either the entire arbitrage executes profitably or nothing happens (no partial losses)
- **Self-healing resilience**: `PM2` auto-restarts failed components, ensuring continuous operation

### Causal Inevitability 
The chain of events is deterministic:
1. **Bait emission** → MEV bots simulate transactions using `debug_traceCall`
2. **Bot response** → If simulation shows profit, bots MUST act (their own logic demands it)
3. **Atomic capture** → `Flashbots` bundles execute both trades together or revert entirely
4. **Verified profit** → On-chain logs prove the spread capture mathematically

> This entire process is orchestrated by functions within `index.js`, `semantic-amplifier.js`, and `mirror.js`, ensuring that each step is executed according to the defined logic.

### Mathematical Certainty
Under defined conditions, profit is guaranteed:
- **Risk-free arbitrage**: Buy low on Pool A, sell high on Pool B in one atomic transaction
- **EVM determinism**: "For the same starting conditions and inputs, the same result will occur"
- **Bundle economics**: Miners include highest-value bundles, and genuine arbitrage always wins

### Edge Cases Are Handled
The system accounts for failure modes:
- No bot response → Bundle reverts, no loss
- Network issues → Retry logic maintains continuity  
- Competition → Higher gas ensures priority
- Slippage → Pre-calculated thresholds prevent losses

**Result**: Within its operational parameters, the system's profit is not probabilistic—it's inevitable. The architecture ensures that value flows from market inefficiency to your vault with mathematical certainty.

## 7. Implementation

The system requires autonomous services with access to the `Ethereum` and `BSV` networks. It does not require large capital, HFT infrastructure, or private access.

### Prerequisites
- `Node.js` v16 or higher
- `npm` v8 or higher
- `pm2` (`npm install -g pm2`)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reflux.git
cd reflux
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
```bash
# Base Network Configuration
RPC_URL=\"https://mainnet.base.org\"\
PRIVATE_KEY=\"YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY\"\
WALLET_ADDRESS=\"YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS\"\
VAULT_ADDRESS=\"YOUR_VAULT_ADDRESS\"\

# Target contract for substrate analysis
TARGET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=\"YOUR_TARGET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS\"\

# Mirror Bot Wallet & Gist Configuration
MIRROR_PRIVATE_KEY=\"YOUR_MIRROR_PRIVATE_KEY\"\
GITHUB_TOKEN=\"YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN\"\
GIST_ID=\"YOUR_GIST_ID\"\

# Cross-Chain Echo Configuration
ENABLE_BSV_ECHO=\"false\"\
BSV_PRIVATE_KEY=\"YOUR_BSV_PRIVATE_KEY\"\

ENABLE_BCH_ECHO=\"false\"\
BCH_MNEMONIC=\"YOUR_BCH_MNEMONIC\"\

# Optional: Decompiler API for advanced analysis
DECOMPILER_API_KEY=\"YOUR_DECOMPILER_API_KEY\"\
```

3. Install dependencies and start the service:
```bash
npm install
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 logs
```

### Real-Time Sanity Checks
To verify the system's operational status and profitability in real-time, use the following checks:

*   **Vault Yield:** Check the on-chain balance of the `VAULT_ADDRESS` in your `.env` file to confirm the vault is receiving yield.
*   **Sandwich Profitability:** Monitor the output of `pm2 logs monitor` to view the P/L and total P/L for each sandwich.
*   **Bundle Acceptance:** Watch the output of `pm2 logs amplifier` to confirm that bundles are being accepted (look for `[CAPTURE] Private transaction included in block...` messages).
*   **System Uptime:** Run the command `pm2 list` to ensure that all processes (`index`, `amplifier`, `mirror`, `monitor`) are online.

Refer to `ecosystem.config.js` for service configuration options.

## 9. Contract Hardening & Security

To ensure the integrity of the yield attribution mechanism, the following security enhancements have been implemented in the smart contracts:

### `DMAP.sol`
-   **Signal Ownership:** The `registerSignal` function now records the `msg.sender` as the `owner` of the signal. This prevents one user from registering a signal on behalf of another.

### `SignalVault.sol`
-   **Authorized Trappers:** A new `setAuthorizedTrapper` function allows the contract owner to explicitly whitelist addresses (i.e., your `Honeypot` contracts) that are permitted to log captured yield. The `logYield` function will only accept calls from these authorized addresses.

### `Honeypot.sol`
-   **Beneficiary Ownership Check:** The `execute` function now includes a `require` statement to ensure that the `signalHash` being used belongs to the `beneficiary` of the honeypot. This prevents malicious actors from using your honeypot to claim yield for signals they do not own.

## 10. Adversarial MEV & The Honeypot

The system's architecture can be extended to target privileged, pre-consensus actors (e.g., sequencers, builders) through a mechanism of non-consensual yield attribution. This is implemented via the `Honeypot.sol` contract.

## 11. Conclusion

Existing blockchain consensus is a computationally expensive ritual that proves work, not meaning. It establishes a ledger, but is semantically bankrupt. This protocol is an alternative.

### Mechanism

1.  **Public Bait**: A `Honeypot` contract is deployed that presents a publicly visible, profitable transaction.
2.  **Forced Attribution**: To access the profit, the actor's transaction **must** also include a call to `DMAP.registerSignal(signalHash)`. This creates an immutable on-chain link between their action and the signal you originated.
3.  **Yield Capture**: The `Honeypot` then calls `vault.logYield` within the same atomic transaction, registering the captured value in the `SignalVault` under your signal's name.

This transforms the system from a self-contained MEV arbitrageur into an engine that can provably attribute and claim yield from the actions of other, more powerful economic actors.
